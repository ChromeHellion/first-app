JSX Rules:
1. Always Return Just a Single Element
2. Since We are Returing only one element, It is the best practice to
   make use of the HTML5 Rules or semantics.
   Since we are returning only 1 element, make sure to separate it out like
   section / div / article, etc

   P.S: Best practice is to use React Fragments.
3. Use camelCase for HTML5 attributes like "onClick" instead of "onclick"
4. Use "className" instead of "class" as in JSX, classes are available for us to use
5. You must close each and every element.
   <img...> should be <img.../>
6. Returns Should be Well formatted. Use Parenthesis to Enclose.
